If the temperature of their location is above a certain degree mark, a cold drink recipe is returned; if the temperature is below a certain degree mark, a hot drink recipe is returned.\n                </p>\n                <div \n                  className=\"WhatllItBeImage\">\n                </div>\n                    <h3>Technologies Used:</h3> \n                   <h4>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, PostGreSQL</h4>\n                  <h4> \n                    <a href=\"https://whatll-it-be-app.reperez120.now.sh/\" \n                    target=\"_blank\"> \n                    Live Version\n                    </a> \n                  </h4>\n                  <h4>\n                <a href=\"https://github.com/reperez120/whatll-it-be-app-client\" \n                target=\"_blank\"> Client Repo\n                </a> \n              </h4>  \n              <h4> \n                <a href=\"https://github.com/reperez120/whatll-it-be-mvp\"\n                target=\"_blank\">\n                API Repo\n                </a>\n              </h4>\n              <br></br>\n              <h2>\n                Cat-A-Log\n              </h2>\n                <p>\n                The Cat-A-Log app uses the Cat API and the PetFinder API to display a list of cats with user-selected traits that are up for adoption in a specified area. The user selects desired traits in checkboxes and then inputs their zip code into an input form. Once the user clicks the form’s submit button, an event listener is triggered that fetches the Cat API, which contains a list of cat breeds and their characteristics, and returns an array of breeds that have the traits the user selected in the checkbox. The app next fetches the PetFinder API, which contains a list of pets up for adoption, and uses the breeds that were returned from the Cat API and the geographic area the user input as query parameters to return a list of cats with desired traits up for adoption in the user’s geographic area. The app then displays the returned array of cats’ names, photos, descriptions, and links to their adoption pages.\n                </p>\n                <div \n                  className=\"CatALogImage\">\n                </div>\n                <h3>Technologies Used: </h3> \n                <h4>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, APIs</h4>\n              <h4> \n                <a href=\"https://reperez120.github.io/CatALogApp/\" \n                target=\"_blank\"> \n                Live Version\n                </a> \n              </h4>\n              <h4> \n                <a href=\"https://github.com/reperez120/CatALogApp\" \n                target=\"_blank\"> Repo Version\n                </a> \n              </h4>\n              <h2>\n              <br></br>\n                A Hard Day's Night\n              </h2>\n                <p>\n                  A fairly standard multiple choice quiz, A Hard Day’s Quiz uses a form element and radio buttons to present users with ten multiple choice questions on the Beatles.
