                  My name is Rachel and I enjoy working with languages, computer and human. I am technical writer and web developer with experience using
                  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Node, Express, React, and PostgreSQL to design, build, and deploy full stack web apps. I am looking to 
                  deepen my knowledge in those areas and expand it to others by working on additional development and technical writing projects.
